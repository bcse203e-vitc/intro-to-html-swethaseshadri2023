    <p style="font-family:'Tahoma'; font-size: 50px;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. </p>
    <p style="font-family:'Arial Black'; font-size: 50px;">Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Serif'; font-size: 50px;">It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Brush Script MT'; font-size: 50px;">It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
