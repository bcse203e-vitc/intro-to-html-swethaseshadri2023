    <p>In this book, <u>McKernan</u> goes beyond the event, and dives into what it means to discover your truth and speak it, why people should do this, and then <i><b>deeply</b></i> explains exactly how this can be done. If you feel living more <i><b>authentically</b></i> could allow you to have a <i><b>greater</b></i> impact on others, or you canâ€™t find the words to speak your truth as <i><b>boldly</b></i> as you know you need to, this is the book for you.</p>
